This directory contains files and directories relating to spell checking.
Files in this directory should not be altered, if you do want to change
any of these files then copy the file to the corresponding location in
StrED_cfg first. For example, to override StartSpell first copy it to
the directory StrED_cfg.UserPrefs.SpellCheck, then modify it.

             related initialisation.
