    SpeakSED
===========================================================================


Introduction
============

    SpeakSED allows you to use eSpeak, by Jonathan Duddington, to read
    StrongED texts aloud.

    For this to work eSpeak must be installed on your system and seen by
    the Filer. See the Installation section below for details.


Installation
============

    You don't have to install SpeakSED itself as it comes included with
    StrongED but you may have to install eSpeak which is used by SpeakSED to
    do the actual speaking.

Installing eSpeak

    To install eSpeak you'll first need to download the RISC OS version from
    the <eSpeak website=>#url http://espeak.sourceforge.net> (eSpeak
    requires RISC OS 3.6 or later with 16 bit sound system enabled).

    After downloading, copy !eSpeak to a location, of your choosing, on your
    harddisc. Double-click eSpeak to load the Speak module. You can now use
    SpeakSED to read StrongED texts out loud through eSpeak.

    If you want to use SpeakSED regularly without having to Double-click
    eSpeak each time you can either:

    - Add eSpeak to Boot -> Look at

      Open the root directory of your harddisc and double-click '!Boot'. In
      the window that opens, click on 'Boot' and then click 'Look at'. Drag
      the eSpeak application to the 'look at' window.

    - Add eSpeak to Boot.Resources

      Open the root directory of your harddisc and double-click '!Boot'
      with Shift held down to open the '!Boot' directory. Next open the
      'Resources' directory and drag the eSpeak application to this
      directory.


How to use
==========

    Using SpeakSED is very simple. Clicking on the 'Speak' icon on
    StrongED's toolbar opens the SpeakSED window.

    Click the 'Speak' button to start the text being read out loud. Click
    the same button again, now labeled 'Mute', to stop.

    The 'Close' button will close the window. This will also stop the
    speech, if active.


Configuration
=============

    SpeakSED provides access to some of eSpeak's command line options.
    These are the voice, the speed and the volume used when a text is spoken.

    To make changes to the settings permanent click on the 'Save' button.

History
=======

  v1.01 (05 Oct 2014) - Better error message

    è When eSpeak wasn't available the error 'SWI name not known in Speak'
      was raised which wasn't very user friendly. Now a more informative
      message is shown and the SpeakSED manual is opened.

  v1.00 (20 Sep 2011) - First working version
