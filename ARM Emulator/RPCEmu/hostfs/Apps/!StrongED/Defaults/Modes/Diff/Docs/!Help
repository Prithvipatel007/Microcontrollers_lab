StrongED Mode	Diff
Purpose		Provide support for diff files in StrongED
Version		0.09, 14 August 2004
Copyright	Philip Ludlam 2004


 Requirements
==============

This mode has been designed to take advantage of features only available in
the latest 4.67a4 version of StrongED. It should be possible to modify the
ModeWhen and ModeFile files in order for it to work with previous versions.


 Installing the StrongED Diff Mode
======================================

Once downloaded the StrongED Diff Mode needs to be installed.
To do this, copy the supplied !StrED_Cfg application over your existing
!StrED_Cfg .


 Syntax Colouring
==================

The main emphasis of this mode is to allow StrongED to colour diff files.

It supports the diff files generated by GNU Diff and cvs diff (including the two RISC OS ports of CVS). It does not support diff files generated by !Diff .


 Search and replace expressions
================================

The Diff mode defines several search expressions.
Those that might be useful will be detailed below when support for diff and diff -c has been added to them .


 Actions
=========

To aid examination of source code files, shift double clicking on filenames within the diff output StrongED will try to find and load the files into StrongED. StrongED automatically converts the filename from the UNIX/URL like format into the usual RISC OS format.


 To Do
=======

 è Add support for diff and diff -c to the search expressions. 
 è To make use of new StronED features as and when they are implemented.
 è Until then, I have no plans to extend this mode (other than to fix bugs).


 About the StrongED Diff Mode
==============================

The StrongED Diff Mode is still being developed. I do appreciate ideas for its
development and bug reports.

The StrongED Diff Mode is freeware. It may be freely distributed so long as no
charge is made for the Mode itself (excluding media costs). If you distribute
the StrongED Diff Mode on a CD compilation or such-like then you must contact
me for the latest version.

Permission from me (the author) must be sort before distributing modified
version of the StrongED Diff Mode or incorporating any part of the mode into
any StrongED Mode, or any piece of software.

There is no warranty, either expressed or implied, and the StrongED Diff Mode
is not guaranteed fit for use in any situation. I (the author) take no
responsibility for any (mis)use of the StrongED Diff Mode by you (the user)
and can accept no responsibility for any loss or damage incurred by doing so.

The StrongED Diff Mode and more are available from http://www.philipnet.com/ .
If you find a bug in any of my programs or have ideas for their improvement
then please contact me at mailto:philip@philipnet.com or through my web site.
