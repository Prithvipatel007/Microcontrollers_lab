SysLog Mode
===========

This mode for StrongED can be used to view logs generated by !Syslog (the Tom Hughes app) or !Syslogs (the RISC OS Select app).

It should automatically be selected when opening logs stored in their original location within the application, irrespective of whether they are filetyped as text or data. It can also be selected manually if the logs are stored elsewhere.

The features are that;

- lines are not wrapped (well, actually they are, but at 999 characters)

- the datestamp (data and time) and error ID of the log entries are shown in a different colour

- specific words or phrases in the logs related to errors, problems and failures can be shown in a distinctive colour (red)

- specific words or phrases can be easily added by users to show certain log entries as desired

See separate Version file for version info.

You are welcome to contact me if you have any suggestions for this mode. The best way to do this is to go to www.timebus.co.uk, find the section of the web site for contacting Timebus Travel, and send an email to the address given there.

I would also recommend the StrongED mailing list for help and advice.
