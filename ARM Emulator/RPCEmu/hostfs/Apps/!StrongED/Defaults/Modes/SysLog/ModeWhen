Rules Include
# !Syslog* below caters for !Syslog (Tom Hughes) and !Syslogs (RISC OS Select)
 fff, **.!SysLog*.Logs.**
# below line is for logs of filetype data.
# Dump mode would normally claim these,
# so we have to claim them 'back' by applying a match rule ( beginning with '>')
# after the file is loaded.
# _dummy is only there because match rules must have a match expression
