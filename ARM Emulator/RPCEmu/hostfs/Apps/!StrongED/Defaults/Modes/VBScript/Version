Version History
===============

The version number of this mode is the uppermost number in the version history below.

1.01 EP 2005-11-06 Updated !Help file- references StrongED not StrongEd, syntax group 'ID' now called Identifiers, Mentioned alt. colour scheme
                   Background now very dark grey instead of black, so you can see the left window border as a black line with overlapping windows
                   Background colour no longer set for syntax group 'Identifiers' (should not have been)
                   Added ColoursStd file- colours now set when 'alt colour scheme' is NOT selected in global choices (but used the same colours as before)
                   Added Resources folder, containing UK.Messages file which now gives the syntax groups in the choices menu friendly names instead of numbers
                   Tested with StrongED version 4.67 alpha 9
                   Distribution of mode in zip file now uses !StrED_cfg shell
                   
1.00 EP 2004-06-21 First release
                   Added 'preserve' and 'goto 0' statements
