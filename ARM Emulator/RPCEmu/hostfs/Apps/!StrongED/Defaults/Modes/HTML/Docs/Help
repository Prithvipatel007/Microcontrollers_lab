 About the StrongED HTML Mode
==============================

The StrongED HTML Mode is still being developed. I do appreciate ideas for its
development and bug reports.

The StrongED HTML Mode is freeware. It may be freely distributed so long as no
charge is made for the program itself (excluding media costs). If you
distribute the StrongED HTML Mode on a CD compilation or such-like then you
must contact me for the latest version.

There is no warranty, either expressed or implied, and the StrongED HTML Mode
is not guaranteed fit for use in any situation. I (the author) take no
responsibility for any (mis)use of the StrongED HTML Mode by you (the user)
and can accept no responsibility for any loss or damage incurred by doing so.

The StrongED HTML Mode and more are available from http://www.philipnet.com/ .
If you find a bug in any of my programs or have ideas for their improvement
then please contact me at mailto:philip@philipnet.com or through my web site.
