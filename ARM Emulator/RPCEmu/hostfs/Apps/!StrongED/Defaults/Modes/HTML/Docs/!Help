 Installing the StrongED HTML Mode
===================================

Once downloaded the StrongED HTML Mode needs to be installed in StrongED. To
do this copy the directory ê!StrED_cfgë over your existing copy of
ê!StrED_cfgë (usually found in !Boot.Choices or
!Boot.Choices.Users.<user_name> .


 Important
===========

The HTML mode makes use of several new features introduced in version 4.65
Alpha 2 of StrongEd. Please make sure that you are using 4.65 Alpha 2 or later
before installing this HTML mode.


 Features
==========

** New **

With this version shift double-clicking on an URL (in the form of a href="å",
src="å" or in a PHP include(), include_once(), require() or require_once()
call) will result in the URL being downloaded if required and opened for
editing by a suitable application.

To get external files the program wget (supplied with the mode) is invoked. To
quote from it's Readme file: [Wget] is 32-bit compatible, and is suitable for
all RISC OS ARM6, ARM7, StrongARM and XScale machines. It may not be suitable
for earlier machines.
If someone can confirm whether it works on RISC OS 3.1 or not please let both
me and Chocky know. Thanks.

 About the StrongED HTML Mode
==============================

The StrongED HTML Mode is still being developed. I do appreciate ideas for its
development and bug reports.

The program 'wget' supplied with the mode in
!StrED_cfg.UserPrefs.Modes.HTML.Tools does not fall under this licence and is
subject to the GPL (see the accompanying file GPL for the details of that
licence).

The StrongED HTML Mode is freeware. It may be freely distributed so long as no
charge is made for the Mode itself (excluding media costs). If you distribute
the StrongED HTML Mode on a CD compilation or such-like then you must contact
me for the latest version.

Permission from me (the author) must be sort before distributing modified
version of the StrongED HTML Mode or incorporating any part of the mode into
any StrongED Mode, or any piece of software.

There is no warranty, either expressed or implied, and the StrongED HTML Mode
is not guaranteed fit for use in any situation. I (the author) take no
responsibility for any (mis)use of the StrongED HTML Mode by you (the user)
and can accept no responsibility for any loss or damage incurred by doing so.

The StrongED HTML Mode and more are available from http://www.philipnet.com/ .
If you find a bug in any of my programs or have ideas for their improvement
then please contact me at mailto:philip@philipnet.com or through my web site.
