| Do not add anything to this section, add to the user specific section below

| See the 'Spell checking' section of the manual to find out more.

| StrongED uses the ResFind program from the German Archimedes Group to decide
| which set of resources to use (UK or Germany). You can force it to use one
| or the other by setting the variable below
|
|Set StrongED$Language Germany

| This variable can be used on big-memory machines to prevent StrongED from
| claiming too much of the address space for its dynamic area. It's in MB's
|
|Set StrongED$MaxArea 32

| This variable controls where files generated by StrongED's export function
| are stored. Obviously the ramdisc would be fastest but as the files can be
| quite big we'll default it to Scrap.
Set StrongED$ExportDir <StrongED$ScrapDir>

| Initialise ScriptSED
Do IfThere StrongED_Read:Tools.!ScriptSED Then Obey StrongED_Read:Tools.!ScriptSED.!Boot
